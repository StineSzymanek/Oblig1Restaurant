    <h1>Accessibility report</h1>
    <p> While making this website we had a few ways to keep accessibility in mind.
        We had to make sure the whole website was accessible for those who navigate only using the keyboard.
        Since the menu is just on one page, you can use the arrow keys to see all the information.
        This report is reached by a link, and that link is also keyboard focusable. Another thing we had in mind was
        the colors of the website. We made sure that everything had enough contrast for readability purposes. We also chose to 
        only use two different fonts that are sans-serif for readability purposes. The images on the page all have an alternative
        text so that screen readers can interpret them. 

        We used AChecker, and since that didn't show any errors, we tried WAVE - web accessibility evaluation tool. That tool
        didn't show any errors either, but the tool reminded us that manual testing is still necessary. One test we did was zooming
        in 200% on the page, since it's a WCAG requirement that the page still works when you zoom in up to 200%. We saw that the
        content didn't overlap and the page still worked as it should. We tried using the Mac in-built screen reader to catch any problems
        we have overlooked, and decided to put "Allergens: none" instead of just "Allergens: " on the dishes that had no allergens,
        beause it seemed to make more sense when read out loud.
