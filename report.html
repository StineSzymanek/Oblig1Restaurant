    <h1>Accessibility report</h1>
    <p> While making this website we had a few ways to keep accessibility in mind.
        We had to make sure the whole website was accessible for those who navigate only using the keyboard.
        Since the menu is just on one page, you can use the arrow keys to see all the information.
        This report is reached by a link, and that link is also keyboard focusable. Another thing we had in mind was
        the colors of the website. We made sure that everything had enough contrast for readability purposes.
