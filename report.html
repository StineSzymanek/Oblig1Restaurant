    <h1>Accessibility report</h1>
    <p>
        While making this website we had a few ways to keep accessibility in mind.
        We had to make sure the whole website was accessible for those who navigate only using the keyboard.
        Since the menu is just on one page, you can use the arrow keys to see all the information.
        This report is reached by a link, and that link is also keyboard focusable. Other than that, we don't have
        anything on the page that someone can click on with a mouse, so from our understanding the other elements
        (like headings and paragraphs) aren't supposed to be keyboard focusable. The images on the page all have an
        alternative
        text so that screen readers can interpret them.
        Another thing we had in mind was
        the colors of the website. We made sure that everything had enough contrast for readability purposes. We also
        chose to
        only use two different fonts that are sans-serif for readability purposes. Sans-serif is supposed to be
        the best type of font for people with low vision and people with dyslexia.

        We used AChecker, and since that didn't show any errors, we tried WAVE - web accessibility evaluation tool. That
        tool
        didn't show any errors either, but the tool reminded us that manual testing is still necessary. One test we did
        was zooming
        in 200% on the page, since from what we found it's a WCAG requirement that the page still works when you zoom in
        up to 200%. We saw
        that the
        content didn't overlap, and the page still worked as it should. We tried using the Mac in-built screen reader to
        catch any problems
        we have overlooked and decided to put "Allergens: none" instead of just "Allergens: " on the dishes that had no
        allergens,
        because it seemed to make more sense when read out loud. The screen reader was a bit difficult to use, so it
        might be preferable
        to have someone who actually uses one testing the webpage, because we don't know if the way we used it was
        realistic.
